1. Go through hello.py and explain the basics of TKinter. 
2. Work as a class to create a basic tic-tac-toe interface where clicking buttons alternates between X's and O's
3. Have students pair up to create a `checkWin` function that checks whether a player has won, or if all squares have been filled. If either of these things happen, make an alert for the players and start a new game.
