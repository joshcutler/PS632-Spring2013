Make sure everyone understands:

1. `try`
2. `except`
3. `else`
4. `finally`
5. `raise`
6. Big-Oh notation

First, play with dictionaries. (Look back at `roman_numify` code in `lab1.py`.)

Then, go through FizzBuzz as a group (write it on the fly). At first, handle the special case of 15 and its multiples as an exception, and then handle it appropriately. 

Collectively write an algorithm to find the square root of X. (Downey 2008: 66) Hint: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method 

Now, have students form groups of 2-3 to accomplish as many of the following tasks as possible with the time remaining (give them the test cases):

1. Find the greatest common divisor of A and B. (Downey 2008: 61) Hint: wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm. This is also the fifth problem on Project Euler. 
2. Make a function that inverts Roman numify. You can do this the slow way (iterating through all keys and checking values) or the fast way (reverse lookup).
3. Implement linear search (Zelle 2002: 226)
4. Implement binary search (Zelle 2002: 227)

Be sure to graph algorithmic performance. 

Keep in mind that there is a recursive version of binary search, which will be helpful for students next week when they create linked lists.
