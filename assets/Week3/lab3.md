# Algorithms

## Introduction

The most important thing to point out is that algorithms are *everywhere*. Don't get scared just because it's a fancy word. An algorithm is just a set up steps that take input and produce output. (Identity is the simplest algorithm--it returns the input it receives without changing it.) Here are a couple examples:

- Kraft Mac and Cheese [algorithm](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Kraft%C2%AE-Macaroni-and-Cheese)
- Shampoo [algorithm](http://faculty.cooper.edu/smyth/cs111/lightout/fc_ex2.png)--notice anything wrong here? 

## Group examples

Then, go through FizzBuzz as a group (write it on the fly). At first, handle the special case of 15 and its multiples as an exception, and then handle it appropriately. 

Make sure everyone understands:

1. `try`
2. `except`
3. `else`
4. `finally`
5. `raise`
6. Big-Oh notation

## Lab practice 

Now, have students form groups of 2-3 to accomplish as many of the following tasks as possible with the time remaining (give them the test cases):

1. write an algorithm to find the square root of X. (Downey 2008: 66) Hint: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method  
2. Find the greatest common divisor of A and B. (Downey 2008: 61) Hint: wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm. This is also the fifth problem on Project Euler. 
3. Find prime numbers up to 121 using the Sieve of Erasthones: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes

Be sure to graph algorithmic performance. 

Keep in mind that there is a recursive version of binary search, which will be helpful for students next week when they create linked lists.
