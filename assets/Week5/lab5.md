Today we're working with Application Programming Interfaces (API's).

As an example, we're going to use the Huffington Post [Pollster API](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api). Conveniently for our purposes, there is a Python [library](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pollster) that makes working with the API simple. Other journalism publishers also offer API's including [USA Today](http://developer.usatoday.com/docs/read/articles) and [The New York Times](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs). You can find a whole list of politics-related API's [here](http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/politics). 

First, everyone needs to install the Python library:
`pip install pollster`

Then, go through examples in lab4.py.
