This week's lab is based on several useful sources:
 
- *Python for Data Analysis* by Wes McKinney
- http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/logistic-regression-and-python.html. 
- http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/setting-up-scientific-python.html
- http://pandas.pydata.org/getpandas.html
- and here: http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html

Rather than installing everything at the beginning of lab, use http://www.pythonanywhere.com. It's free to log in and run a console, and already has pandas, numpy, and scipy installed. 

If people want to do this on their own system, they should look into the following libraries:
- `numpy` (should already have this)
- `pandas` (for data handling)
- `statsmodels` (for modeling)
- `pylab` (for plotting)

Other things you can do with pandas, not covered here:

- handle missing values
- compute 1st differences & % chg for time series
- hierarchical indexing
