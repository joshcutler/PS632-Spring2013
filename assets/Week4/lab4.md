First, play with dictionaries. (Look back at `roman_numify` code in `lab1.py`.)

Now, make a function that inverts Roman numify. You can do this the slow way (iterating through all keys and checking values) or the fast way (reverse lookup).

1. Implement linear search (Zelle 2002: 226)
2. Implement binary search (Zelle 2002: 227)

Then, go through a recursive version of binary search.
