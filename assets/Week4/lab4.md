First, play with dictionaries using `roman_numify` code.

Introduce the concept of an [Eulerian path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path) and an Eulerian tour.

Discuss chain networks and ring networks. Also describe how these would be represented in an adjacency matrix.

Now, explain `make_link()` and the `ring` network. 

Discuss a grid network. Use the code to count how many edges a 16x16 grid network would have. 

Explain that all these networks are instances of planar graphs: they can be represented in two dimensional space. In general, *n-m+r=2* where *r* is the number of regions, m is the number of edges, and n is the number of nodes.
